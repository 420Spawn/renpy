**RenPy Programmer**

Hi, I'm an experienced RenPy programmer looking for projects to work on. If you need specific gameplay mechanics programmed or a programmer for your entire game, I'm with doing either. :)

About me:
- Experienced with Ren'Py and Python (I also know Unity Engine and C#)
- I've created gameplay mods for many well known Ren'Py adult games (Depraved Awakening, Mythic Manor, Harem Hotel, etc)
- I've also done graphic/UI design for years so those are additional areas I have experience with.

Here are some examples of code I've written/Python tutorials I've made:

I'm only interested in paid work. If you'd prefer to do revenue sharing that's fine if your game already has some exposure. Feel free to message me if you would like to talk or have any questions. :)

**RenPy Programmer**

Hi, I'm an experienced Ren'Py programmer looking for projects to work on. If you need specific gameplay mechanics programmed or a programmer for your entire game, I'm with doing either. :)

About me:
- Experienced with Ren'Py and Python (I also know Unity Engine and C#)
- I've created gameplay mods for many well known Ren'Py adult games (Depraved Awakening, Mythic Manor, Harem Hotel, etc)
- I've also done graphic/UI design for years so those are additional areas I have experience with.

Here are some examples of code I've written/Python tutorials I've made:
